Until today, any numbers you used in your programs were basically integers or floating
point numbers, or any of their variants (short, char, long, double, etc). From your previous reading, itâ€™s safe to assume that integers and floating point numbers have opposite
caracteristics.
But today, this will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome number
type: fixed point numbers! Always missing from most languages scalar types, fixed point
numbers offer a valuable balance between performance, accuracy, range and precision that
explains why these numbers are widely used in graphics, sound or scientific programming
to name a few.
