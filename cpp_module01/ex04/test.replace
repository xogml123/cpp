caracteristics.
But today, this will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome number
type: fixed point numbers! Always missing from most languages scalar types, fixed point
numbers offer a valuable balance between perf124125mance, accuracy, range and precision that
explains why these numbers are widely used in graphics, sound 124125 scientific programming
to name a few.
